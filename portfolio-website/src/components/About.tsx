              As a Junior Developer, I possess a good background of skills in
              HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, React and Tailwind.
              Currently, I am refining my craft in designing and maintaining
              responsive websites that offer a smooth user experience. My
              expertise lies in utilizing cutting-edge development tools and
              techniques to craft engaging interfaces through writing clean and
              optimized code. I am always looking to expand my skillset and
              close the gap between my front-end and back-end development.
